## Summary

Browser extension that checks the current URL, and displays a banner at the top of the page warning of dubious content.

The initial was a simple [proof-of-concept](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/11/heres-a-browser-extension-that-will-flag-fake-news-sites.html) to show steps users and developers could take to combat prolific producers of online misinformation.

## Features

* Create a banner at the top of the page for sites on the watch list.
* Tag the anchor text of links which will lead to watch list sites (currently only on Facebook).

## Future Feature List

* Tag links on other popular sites.
* Multiple lists with more specific warnings: [Fake News], [Satire], [Tabloid], etc.
* Add ability to modify watch lists.

## Some other stuff
